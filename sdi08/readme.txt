Lab 8: remoting
- convert your project from a client-server application using sockets to an application using RMI
- use Spring remoting
- data must be persisted to a database; use JdbcTemplate (Spring)
- use Gradle for dependency management
- xml configuration for Spring is not allowed; annotations and Java Config classes only
